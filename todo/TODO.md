# Tasks for this paper

This is list of things that I need **to do** for this paper.

 * describe ROQ
   * describe how it is used for the Student's t-likelihood when the data are in smaller stationary chunks
 * show that the ROM only needs 4 orthogonal models to describe the parameter space when no phase parameters are used (and for the ROQ that this is equivalent to being able to pre-sum over antenna pattern functions)
 * test it over a variety of parameter spaces to evaluate the number of ROM vectors required and code speed-ups (perform tests on pure noise and on simulated signals) - all these need runs using the non-ROQ version for comparison)
   * compare likelihood values
   * test over just sky position
   * test over just frequency
   * test over several frequency derivatives
   * test over some binary parameters (maybe ellipticity)
